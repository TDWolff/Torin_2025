    "\n",
    "- **Reusable data structures** for storing, retrieving, and manipulating groups of objects.\n",
    "- Examples: `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Collectibles?\n",
    "- Efficiently manage groups of objects.\n",
    "- Built-in methods for searching, sorting, and filtering.\n",
    "- Improve code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Collectibles\n",
    "- **List**: Ordered, allows duplicates (e.g., `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`).\n",
    "- **Set**: Unordered, no duplicates (e.g., `HashSet`, `TreeSet`).\n",
    "- **Map**: Key-value pairs (e.g., `HashMap`, `TreeMap`).\n",
    "- **Queue**: FIFO (e.g., `LinkedList`, `PriorityQueue`).\n",
    "- **Stack**: LIFO (e.g., `Stack`, `ArrayDeque`).\n",
    "- **Deque**: Double-ended queue (e.g., `ArrayDeque`, `LinkedList`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits\n",
    "- Simplify data management.\n",
    "- Reduce boilerplate code.\n",
    "- Improve performance for common operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Queue Tasks\n",
    "- Modify the `CalculatorQueue` to support more complex operations, such as multiplication and division.\n",
    "- Add a method to handle invalid operations and display an error message.\n",
    "- Create a method to display all operations before processing them and track the result after each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack Tasks\n",
    "- Modify the `CalculatorStack` to reverse the order of addition and handle operations in the LIFO sequence.\n",
    "- Add a method to handle invalid operations and display an error message.\n",
    "- Create a method to display all operations before processing them and track the result after each operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "- Use the **Queue** for processing operations in the order they are added (FIFO).\n",
    "- Use the **Stack** for processing operations in reverse order (LIFO).\n",
    "- Both structures can be enhanced to handle advanced tasks like parentheses or postfix evaluation.\n",

    "<summary><strong>Merge Sorting</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "- Merge sort is a **divide and conquer** algorithm that repeatedly divides the array into smaller subarrays, sorts them, and merges them back together.\n",
    "- Steps:\n",
    "  1. Divide the array into two halves.\n",
    "  2. Sort each half recursively.\n",
    "  3. Merge the two halves back together.\n",
    "  4. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Time Complexity**:\n",
    "  - Best, Worst, and Average Case: **O(n log n)**.\n",
    "  - Efficient for large datasets due to its logarithmic growth.\n",
    "- **Stability**:\n",
    "  - Merge sort is stable, meaning it preserves the order of elements with equal values.\n",
    "- **Comparison with Other Algorithms**:\n",
    "  - Faster than bubble sort for large arrays.\n",
    "  - Similar time complexity to quicksort but preferred for stability and larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "- Highly efficient for large and small arrays.\n",
    "- Stable sorting algorithm.\n",
    "- Handles large datasets well due to its predictable time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "- Requires additional memory for temporary arrays during the merge process.\n",
    "- Slower than simpler algorithms like bubble sort for small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Task\n",
    "- Write a Java program to merge two already sorted arrays into one sorted array.\n",
    "- Bonus: Modify the program to count the number of comparisons made during sorting.\n",

    "<summary><strong>JQuery</strong></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "- **JQuery** is a lightweight JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, and animations.\n",
    "- It uses **selectors** to target HTML elements and apply actions or effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "- **Selectors**: Use `$()` to select HTML elements. For example:\n",
    "  - `$(\"button\")`: Selects all `<button>` elements.\n",
    "  - `$(\"p\")`: Selects all `<p>` elements.\n",
    "- **Event Handling**: Attach events like `click`, `hover`, etc., to elements.\n",
    "  - Example: `$(\"button\").click(function() { ... })` triggers an action when a button is clicked.\n",
    "- **Effects**: Provides methods like `hide()`, `show()`, `fadeIn()`, and `fadeOut()` to manipulate element visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "$(document).ready(function() { // Ensures the DOM is fully loaded\n",
    "    $(\"button\").click(function() { // Selector for all buttons\n",
    "        $(\"p\").hide(); // Hides all <p> elements when a button is clicked\n",
