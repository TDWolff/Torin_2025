    "# Unit 2: Using Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In unit 2, I learned about object-oriented programming concepts in Java, specifically focusing on classes, objects, and methods. The exercises included creating classes with fields and methods, instantiating objects from these classes, and calling methods to perform specific actions. Additionally, I practiced writing constructors to initialize object state and using accessor and mutator methods to get and set field values. This unit emphasized the importance of understanding classes and objects to model real-world entities and implement behavior in Java programs.\n",
