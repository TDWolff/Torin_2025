    "# **Important Notes:**\n",
    "#### **What Is a Java Method?**\n",
    "- A method in Java is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.\n",
    "- Consists of an access modifier (e.g., public or private), a return type (e.g., void if it doesnâ€™t return a value), a method name, optional parameters enclosed in parentheses, and a method body enclosed in curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Part (a):**\n",
    "- this question usually requires you to write a certain method that fits the given test cases and \"rules\" provided by the problem \n",
    "- rules + test cases may be provided as a table or as example method calls\n",
    "- a **precondition**/**postcondition** may be provided by the problem. \n",
    "- a boilerplate segment containing a method declaration is also given\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Point Deductions:**\n",
    "![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/yp2Nvt3/Image-1-7-25-at-12-33-PM.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Part (b):**\n",
    "- this part is similar to part (a) and typically asks you to write a method that satisfies the given set of rules.\n",
    "- it may build upon the method created in part (a) (when this is done, it allows you to assume that the method in part (a) works as intended)\n"
